## Introduction
The NBA, celebrated globally for its unparalleled level of competition and intense rivalries, not only captivates millions of sports enthusiasts but also commands attention for its substantial player salaries. This league, renowned for showcasing some of the most talented athletes in the world, raises a fascinating question that resonates with many of us, especially those among students and teachers who are ardent followers of the NBA. The intrigue lies in understanding why these NBA players exhibit such extraordinary performances and whether their compensation truly reflects their on-court contributions.

This study aims to explore the value of NBA players and the reasons behind the NBA's ability to maintain the highest level of competition and substantial salaries through multidimensional data analysis using R. Our analysis focuses on the following three questions for three members:

1. How do players' physical attributes affect their performance in games, and how does this performance reflect their competitiveness in the NBA? (Part 1)

2. What are the distribution and trends of salaries in the league? (Part 2)

3. Does players' compensation correlate with their minutes per game and actual scoring per game? (Part 3)

Part 1 and Part 2 mainly utilized descriptive statistical methods, creating visualized histograms and dot graphs. Part 3 employed regression analysis to explore the relationship, resulting in line graphs.

## Outlines
### 3.1 Methods in Part 1
In Part 1 of our study, we focused on two main aspects: the physical attributes of NBA players and their various performance metrics. Our data processing approach was methodical and aimed at ensuring accuracy and relevance in our analysis.

1.Personal Attributes Analysis
In the first part of our study, we concentrated on analyzing the personal attributes of NBA players, such as age, height, and weight. We started by loading the data from 'all_seasons.csv' and used functions like str() for an initial overview, identifying the number of observations and assessing missing values. To ensure the accuracy of our findings, we applied the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to remove outliers from these attributes. After this crucial data cleansing step, we reshaped the data using the gather function, allowing us to effectively compare and visualize these attributes. The final step involved creating facet histograms with ggplot2, enhancing our analysis with a visually appealing representation of the distribution of players' physical attributes.

2.Performance Metrics Analysis
For the performance metrics analysis, we reloaded the 'all_seasons.csv' dataset to focus on key performance indicators such as points scored (pts), rebounds (reb), assists (ast), and net rating (net_rating). Following a similar process as with personal attributes, we used the IQR method to eliminate outliers from these metrics. This step was essential for maintaining data consistency and reliability. We then reshaped this performance data into a long format, enabling us to create facet histograms that visually compare the distribution of these metrics. These histograms, plotted using ggplot2, provided an insightful and clear depiction of the performance standards of NBA players, adding depth to our analysis of their competitiveness.

### 3.2 Methods in Part 2
In Part 2 of our study, focusing on NBA salary distribution, we began with a detailed description and cleaning of our data. Utilizing functions like str(), we gained insights into the structure of our dataset, including the total number of observations and a preliminary view of the variables. This step was crucial for ensuring the completeness and accuracy of our analysis, especially as we calculated the total number of missing values within the dataset. The central aspect of our data processing involved transforming the 'payroll' column. By applying the gsub function, we efficiently removed non-numeric characters from the payroll data, converting it into a numeric format essential for our analysis. To maintain the integrity of our study, we filtered out rows with missing values in the 'payroll' column. Further, to facilitate our examination of salary trends over time, we transformed the 'seasonStartYear' column into a categorical variable using the factor function. This adjustment was vital for our visual representation, ensuring that the years were treated as distinct categories. Finally, for the visualization aspect, we utilized the ggplot2 package to create dot plots, a method that effectively showcased the trends and variations in salary distribution across different seasons. These dot plots, enhanced with a minimalistic theme and strategically rotated x-axis labels, provided a clear and engaging depiction of the evolution of NBA salaries over time.

### 3.3 Methods in Part 3
In Part 3, we investigated the relationship between NBA players' salaries and their on-court contributions, specifically focusing on 'average minutes per game' (MP) and 'average field goals per game' (FG). Our initial step involved processing the dataset containing 'players' salaries' (Salary), 'average minutes per game' (MP), and 'average field goals per game' (FG). We converted these key variables into numeric form using the gsub function to remove non-numeric characters, followed by cleaning the data to eliminate missing values.

To analyze the relationship between salary and performance indicators, we utilized two distinct approaches:

1.Linear Regression Analysis: We applied linear regression models to understand the association between players' salaries and their performance metrics (MP and FG). This approach was critical for identifying potential trends and quantifying the strength and direction of the relationships between salary and performance indicators.

2.Aggregation and Line Graphs:For 'MP', we grouped the data by 'MP' and calculated the mean 'Salary' for each group. This aggregation provided us with a clear understanding of how average salaries vary with different levels of on-court playtime.
Similarly, for 'FG', we grouped players based on their 'FG' and calculated the mean 'Salary' for these groups. This helped in assessing how scoring efficiency impacts players' compensation.
After aggregating the data, we used ggplot2 to create line graphs for both 'MP' and 'FG'. These line graphs visually depicted the relationship between the average salary and the grouped performance metrics. By including both points (using geom_point()) and lines (using geom_line()), we offered a comprehensive view of the average salary trends across different performance levels.
The combination of linear regression and line graphs provided a multi-faceted understanding of how NBA players' salaries correlate with their on-court contributions. This analysis not only highlighted the general trends but also allowed us to explore the nuances and variations in salary distribution relative to specific performance metrics.

## Result
The result for the first question(Why NBA is a competitive game) is showing by two histograms. It shows how comoetitive game the NBA is by looking at the physical attributes of NBA players and the players' average age, height, and weight. It indicates that the age is distributed throughout the younger age(20 to 30 years old), which they full of energy and talents. The height is definitely higher than the normal people, which the NBA players are distributed from 190 to 210 cm. According to the latest CDC stats, these are the average heights for U.S. adult men based on age: Ages 20 to 39: 176.1 centimeters, which the NBA players's height is more than the the average heights for U.S. adult men. Also, the NBA players' height are distributed from 90 to 110 kg. The average men weight is about 80kg, which the NBA players' height is more than the average men weight. After that, we did a Performance Metrics Analysis to show how does this performance reflect their competitiveness in the NBA. Both assist, rebound, and points are right-skewed distribution, which means it is pretty hard to perform well in the NBA seasons. It defines how hard the NBA game is, which concluded that NBA is a competitive game. The result for the second question(What are the distribution and trends of salaries in the league?) is showing by a dot graph. Our examination commenced by dissecting salary data across different seasons, unraveling how player compensation has evolved. A dot graph dynamically visualized these temporal trends, illustrating the changing landscape of NBA salaries over several decades. The clear upward trajectory depicted in the graph showcases a consistent and substantial increase in salaries over time. The result for the third question(Does players' compensation correlate with their minutes per game and actual scoring per game?) is showing by two line graphs. The first line graph tells us that the more salary the players get, the more Field Goals Made Per Game Range they would be made. It is a positive correlation.The second line graph tells us that the more salary the players get, the more Minutes Per Game they need to play. These two line graphs depict the condition that they players get more salary needs more contributuon to the team, if they do not play well and play lots of time, then the effect are not equal to the amount of money. This vividly shows us that the combination of linear regression and line graphs provided a multi-faceted understanding of how NBA players' salaries correlate with their on-court contributions in hope to see wethether a new player can fit into the NBA league.
